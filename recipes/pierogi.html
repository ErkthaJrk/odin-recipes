    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pierogi are traditional Polish dumplings that are usually stuffed with
      various types of fillings. Most commonly consumed are "Pierogi Ruskie".
      This recipe calls for sauerkraut filling which in Polish is actually
      called kapusta kiszone.

    <p>
      These pierogies can be boiled or fried in butter, which makes them
      tastier. Serve with sour cream or cottage cheese. I grew up on these
      delicious pierogies. I like to triple the recipe and freeze some for later
      by freezing perogies in a single layer on a tray, then storing them in
      freezer bags.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>⅔ cup cold water</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Potato Filling</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>5 pounds baking potatoes</li>
      <li>1 pound bacon</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sauerkraut Filling</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ pound bacon</li>
      <li>1 (32 ounce) jar sauerkraut - drained, rinsed and minced</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make dough: Combine flour, cold water, beaten egg, and salt in a bowl;
        mix until a smooth dough forms. Cover the bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make potato filling: Place potatoes in a large pot. Add water to cover,
        bring to a boil, and cook until tender, 25 to 35 minutes. Drain and mash
        in the pot until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
        occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices
        on paper towels. Crumble and stir into mashed potatoes. Stir in cheese;
        season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sauerkraut filling: Place bacon in the skillet and cook over
        medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10
        minutes. Drain, crumble, and place in a medium bowl. Stir in sauerkraut,
        then sour cream. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll dough out on a floured surface to 1/8- to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut
        out 3-inch circles with a cookie cutter or an upside-down drinking
        glass. Place a spoonful of potato or sauerkraut filling in the center of
        each circle and fold over, pinching edges together to seal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; drop pierogies in
        boiling water and cook until they float, 4 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
