    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Golabki are cabbage leaves stuffed with ground beef and rice, then
      simmered in tomato soup. This works great in the oven or a slow cooker.
      Serve them with the pan juices and a drizzle of sour cream, or mix the pan
      juices with sour cream and ladle it over the cabbage rolls. They're also
      good with mashed potatoes and a cucumber and sour cream salad. They freeze
      well too — either before or after cooking.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 head cabbage, cored</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups cooked rice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>3 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup</li>
      <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) cans tomato juice, or more to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place cabbage head
        into the pot, cover, and cook until leaves are softened enough to remove
        from the head, about 3 minutes. Remove cabbage from the pot and let sit
        until leaves are cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove 18 whole leaves from the cabbage head, cutting out any thick
        tough center ribs. Set whole leaves aside. Chop the remaining cabbage
        and spread it in the bottom of a casserole dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and
        sauté until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool,
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine beef, pork, cooked rice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large
        bowl. Add onion and mix until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place about 1/2 cup beef mixture onto a cabbage leaf. Roll the leaf
        around beef mixture, tucking in the sides to create an envelope around
        the meat. Repeat to make remaining cabbage rolls. Place cabbage rolls in
        a layer over chopped cabbage in the casserole dish. Season with salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk condensed soup, tomato juice, and ketchup together in a bowl; pour
        over cabbage rolls and cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cabbage is tender and meat is cooked
        through, about 1 hour. Uncover for the last 20 to 30 minutes of cooking.
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
        least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
